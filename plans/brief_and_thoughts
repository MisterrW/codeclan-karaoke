The OO CodeClan Caraoke (CCC)
You have been approached to build software for a Karaoke bar. Specifically, they want you to build a software for checking guests in and out, plus handling songs.
Your program should be test driven and should be able to:
Create rooms, songs and guests
Check in guests to rooms/Check out guests from rooms
Add songs to rooms
Extensions
What happens if there are more guests trying to be checked in than there is free space in the room?
Karaoke venues usually have an entry fee - So the guests could have money so they can pay it.
Advanced extensions
Guests could have a favourite song, and if their favourite song is on the room's playlist, they can cheer loudly! (return a string like "Whoo!")
Rooms can keep track of the entry fees/spending of the guests - maybe add a bar tab/bar class?
Add anything extra you think would be good to have at a karaoke venue!

Room (has max capacity and list of people in it)
Person (has name, money, favorite song)
Jukebox (has song list, instance per room)
Venue (has rooms, has a common area which holds everyone not in the room, has a total earnings)
Player - customised instance of Person which player controls
Plot - the story of the evening. The player progresses through it as they hang out at the karaoke bar. 


Rooms could have genre (rock, cheese) - and this could change based on the preferences of the people in it
If two people have same favorite song and it comes on, they can duet

The metalheads hate it. You're out of the room!
The boogiers hate it.
The cheese-lovers hate it.

They love it! Everyone cheers. Someone hands you a beer.
wine spritzer.
Malibu and lemonade.
You're feeling a bit tipsy.

Jagerbombs!
